# What is this Repo?
This repo serves to help me interact with the CAN bus of my mini r56 to be able to help diagnose issues by sniffing for fault codes , and hopefully be able to re-program the keyless fob feature. By keeping this public , hopefully as information i come across and discover gets added to this repo , maybe someone can also make use of information or help them in any way.


## Useful info
- For the r56 model (2006-2016) the baudrate for the CAN is 500kbps
- If using the DF robotics can shield (https://thepihut.com/products/can-bus-shield-for-arduino?variant=27740718033) , the SPI pin should be 10 (Need to confirm)

## Hardware im using
- Arduino uno
- DF Robotics CAN Shield (https://thepihut.com/products/can-bus-shield-for-arduino?variant=27740718033)
- OBD to DB-9 (https://thepihut.com/products/obd-plug-16-pin-to-de-9-db-9-socket-adapter-cable?variant=39823823044803)
